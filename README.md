# My notes during Prework!

## Description

The motivation behind creating this web application was to help me keep some of my notes all in one place while learning how to code and use some basics along the way.  I created this to prove to myself mostly that I truly am capable of continuing with learning about coding and found out I enjoy it quite a bit along the way.  This project helps keep my notes in one place!  During the time I spent with the pre-work and all lessons included I learned a lot about using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I also found a lot of helpful, useful sites and information to help me in the future during time spent in this class and in my career most likely.
