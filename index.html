        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is an acronym for "Hypertext Markup Language".</li>
          <li>It is used as the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> P inside of <> will create a paragraph for user to see.</li>
          <li> Some styling elements within <> also include "H1,2,3,4,etc." for types of headings, "ul" for unordered lists like the one you're reading right now <br>
          "br" is a line break like you just read, "ol" is an ordered list. </li>
          <li> "li" is used for new lines in a list.</li>
          <li> While adding images use <> "img" src="image file/link" and it helps to add an alt="text" to have a description of the image. </li>
          <li>Adding links uses an anchor, like "< A href="url of link" >title of link(that user sees)< /A >. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is an acronym for "Cascading Stylesheet".</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS.</li>
          <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <li>Inline Styling - used on the html file itself, and only applies to the <br> line or <> it is within, like I used to indent this ordered list.</li>
            <li>Internal Styling - used on the html file itself as well, but it is used by <br> adding a < style > element in the < head > portion and is applied to the whole file. </li>
            <li>External Styling - this is an external CSS file with it's style rules that is linked to <br> the html file with < link rel="stylesheet " href=" location" >.
          </ol>
          <li>An example of an external style rule is using a item, with <br> the property you want to apply the value of the property. This looks kind of like <br>
            this- item { color: red;}. </li>
            <li> the propertied within {} are know as the "declaration".
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it. <br>
          this can also be used without -b and with an existing branch, which will let you switch to it.</li>
          <li>Using "feature/new branch name" while creating a branch helps indicate a new feature. </li>
          <li>Using "git add -A will add all modifications in working directory to staging area to be commited<br>
          the -A indicates add all changes.</li>
          <li>Always remember to sync with others before a pull request. <br>
          this can be done by using "git pull origin "name of main branch" </li>
          <li>Git commit -m "" allows for a message about the commit being made while adding a commit.</li>
          <li>"Git pull origin main" will recieve branches made to local origin - source of pull will be <br>
          in github repository. </li>
          <li>Git push origin "branch name" will push local changes to remote branch.</li>
